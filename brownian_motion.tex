Consider a Brownian motion
\[ P(t),\; t\in[0,T] \]
with diffusion coefficient $ \sigma $ and drift $ \mu $:
\[ dP_t=\mu d t+\sigma d W_t,\]
where $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process.

The the joint p.d.f. of the highest value $a$, the lowest value $b$, and the close value $r$ is given in (Lildholdt, 2002).
also in Cox and Miller ( the theory of stochastic process, P222).
